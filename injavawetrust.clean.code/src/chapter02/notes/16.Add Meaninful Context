##### Add Meaningful Context #####

Imagine that you have variables named firstName, lastName, street, houseNumber, city,
state, and zipcode. Taken together itâ€™s pretty clear that they form an address. But what if
you just saw the state variable being used alone in a method? Would you automatically
infer that it was part of an address?

You can add context by using prefixes: addrFirstName, addrLastName, addrState, and so
on. At least readers will understand that these variables are part of a larger structure. Of
course, a better solution is to create a class named Address. Then, even the compiler knows
that the variables belong to a bigger concept.
