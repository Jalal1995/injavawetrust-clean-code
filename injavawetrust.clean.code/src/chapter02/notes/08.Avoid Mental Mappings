##### Avoid Mental Mappings #####

Readers shouldn’t have to mentally translate your names into other names they already know. 
This problem generally arises from a choice to use neither problem domain terms nor solution domain terms.

This is a problem with single-letter variable names. 
Certainly a loop counter may be named i or j or k (though never l!) if its scope is very small and no other names can conflict with it. 
This is because those single-letter names for loop counters are traditional. 
However, in most other contexts a single-letter name is a poor choice; it’s just a place holder that the reader must mentally map to the actual concept. 
There can be no worse reason for using the name c than because a and b were already taken.

In general programmers are pretty smart people. Smart people sometimes like to show off their smarts by demonstrating their mental juggling abilities.

- One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king. 
Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.
