##### Don't Be Cute #####

If names are too clever, they will be memorable only to people who share the
author’s sense of humor, and only as long as these people remember the joke.

Cuteness in code often appears in the form of colloquialisms or slang. 
For example, don’t use the name whack() to mean kill(). 
Don’t tell little culture-dependent jokes like eatMyShorts() to mean abort().

Say what you mean. Mean what you say.
