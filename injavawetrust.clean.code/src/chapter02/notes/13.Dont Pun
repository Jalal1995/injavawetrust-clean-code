##### Dont Pun #####

Avoid using the same word for two purposes. 
Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.

If you follow the "one word per concept" rule, you could end up with many classes
that have, for example, an add method. As long as the parameter lists and return values of
the various add methods are semantically equivalent, all is well.


Now letâ€™s say we are writing a new class that has a method that puts its single parameter into a collection. 
Should we call this method add? It might seem consistent because we have so many other add methods,
but in this case, the semantics are different, so we should use a name like insert or append instead. 
To call the new method add would be a pun.
