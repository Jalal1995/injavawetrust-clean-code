##### Use Searchable Names #####

Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not
easy to locate across a body of text.

One might easily grep for MAX_CLASSES_PER_STUDENT, but the number 7 could be more
troublesome.

- single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables inside short methods.

The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope.

If a variable or constant might be seen or used in multiple places in a body of code,
it is imperative to give it a search-friendly name
