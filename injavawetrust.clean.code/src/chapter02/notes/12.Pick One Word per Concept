##### Pick one Word per Concept #####

Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, itâ€™s confusing to
have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes. How do you
remember which method name goes with which class? Sadly, you often have to remember
which company, group, or individual wrote the library or class in order to remember which
term was used. Otherwise, you spend an awful lot of time browsing through headers and
previous code samples.
