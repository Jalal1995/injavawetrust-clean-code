##### Dont Add Gratuitous Context #####

In an imaginary application called "Gas Station Deluxe," it is a bad idea to prefix every
class with GSD. Frankly, you are working against your tools. You type G and press the completion
key and are rewarded with a mile-long list of every class in the system. Is that
wise? Why make it hard for the IDE to help you?

Likewise, say you invented a MailingAddress class in GSDâ€™s accounting module, and
you named it GSDAccountAddress. Later, you need a mailing address for your customer contact
application. Do you use GSDAccountAddress? Does it sound like the right name? Ten of
17 characters are redundant or irrelevant

Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no
more context to a name than is necessary.
