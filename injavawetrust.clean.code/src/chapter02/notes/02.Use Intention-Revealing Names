##### Use Intention-Revealing Names #####

Choosing good names takes time but saves more than it takes
So take care with your names and change them when you find better ones. 
Everyone who reads your code (including you) will be happier if you do.

The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. 
It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.

If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.
 
Choosing names that reveal intent can make it much easier to understand and change code. 

With these simple name changes, it’s not difficult to understand what’s going on. This is the power of choosing good names.
