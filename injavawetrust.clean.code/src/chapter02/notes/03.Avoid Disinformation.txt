##### Avoid Disinformation #####

Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. 
We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning

Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless itâ€™s actually a List
So accountGroup or bunchOfAccounts or just plain accounts would be better.

Spelling similar concepts similarly is information. Using inconsistent spellings is disinformation.
