##### Use Solution Domain Names #####

Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So go ahead and use
computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth. It
is not wise to draw every name from the problem domain because we donâ€™t want our
coworkers to have to run back and forth to the customer asking what every name means
when they already know the concept by a different name.
